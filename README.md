#Url-with-https

Hi guys ,

Without further introduction

this tool is very simple. goal for this pyhton tool is to add the https protocol to the beginning of list-Url

some subdomain enumeration tools get subdomains without " https or http " protocol and some automations tools don't support list of subdomains dont have the "https/http"

so, i think u understand about this tool

thanks
